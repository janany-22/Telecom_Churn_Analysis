**Telecom-Churn-Analysis**


Exploring the Orange S.A., formerly France Telecom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation.
The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer cancelled the subscription. 
Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.


**Proposed Solution**

Orange S.A., previously known as France Telecom S.A., is a global telecommunications company based in France. 

To address customer churn, we will analyze the Orange Telecom Churn Dataset, which includes customer activity data and a churn label indicating subscription cancellations.
 
The analysis will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building to identify key factors contributing to churn. 

Based on these findings, we will provide actionable recommendations for enhancing customer retention. 

These may include improving customer service, offering personalized promotions, and addressing common issues leading to churn.


**Algorithm & Deployment**


To analyze customer churn for Orange S.A., we will first load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure. We will preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
 Next, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to identify patterns and relationships. We will then conduct correlation analysis and use machine learning models to determine feature importance.
 The dataset will be split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate various classification models. Model performance will be assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Based on the analysis, we will summarize key factors influencing churn and provide actionable recommendations for customer retention. 
Visualization dashboards will be created, and a comprehensive report will be compiled to present the findings. The trained model will be saved and an API will be developed using Flask to enable model predictions. Finally, the Flask app will be deployed to a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or IBM Cloud, with ongoing monitoring and maintenance.


**Conclusion**


Comprehensive Analysis : Effective churn analysis involves understanding data, preprocessing, and applying machine learning models to identify key factors driving churn.
Predictive Modeling : Using predictive models helps anticipate customer departures and implement proactive retention strategies.
Advanced Techniques : Future improvements can include exploring advanced modeling techniques and real-time prediction systems.
Customer Segmentation : Detailed segmentation allows for more targeted and effective retention strategies.
Integration and Explainability : Integrating models with CRM systems and ensuring model explainability enhance the overall effectiveness of churn predictions and retention efforts.
Customers with the International Plan tend to churn more frequently.
Customers with four or more customer service calls churn more than four times as often as do the other customers.
Customers with high day minutes and evening minutes tend to churn at a higher rate than do the other customers.
